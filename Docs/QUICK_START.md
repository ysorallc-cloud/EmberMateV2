3. **The data is stored in localStorage** with key: `'healthTrackerData'`

4. **To clear data**: 
   - Use the Clear button, OR
   - Browser console: `localStorage.removeItem('healthTrackerData')`

5. **Make sure `sample-data.json` is in the same folder** as your index.html

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

**Button doesn't appear?**

- Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Data not loading?**
- Ensure `sample-data.json` is in the correct folder
- Check file name is exactly `sample-data.json`
