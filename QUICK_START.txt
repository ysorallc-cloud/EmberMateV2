# Or on Linux
xdg-open landing.html
```

**Option B: Jump Straight to the App**
```bash

```

### Step 2: Use a Local Server (Optional but Recommended)

# Using Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Using npm scripts (if you have package.json)
npm start          # Opens landing page
npm run start:app  # Opens main app
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8000/landing.html`
