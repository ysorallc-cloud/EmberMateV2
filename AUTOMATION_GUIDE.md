# 🤖 EmberMate v2.0 - Automation Guide

## What I've Automated For You

I've created **3 automated deployment scripts** that handle the entire GitHub upload process!

---

## 🎯 Three Automation Options

### ⭐ Option 1: Full Automated Script (Recommended)

**File:** `deploy-to-github.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `deploy-to-github.ps1` (Windows)

**What it does:**
- ✅ Clones or updates your repository
- ✅ Copies all new files automatically
- ✅ Handles README renaming
- ✅ Creates Git commit with detailed message
- ✅ Pushes to GitHub
- ✅ Offers to deploy to Vercel
- ✅ Full error handling and status messages

**How to use:**

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# 1. Make executable
chmod +x deploy-to-github.sh

# 2. Run it
./deploy-to-github.sh

# 3. Follow the prompts!
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell
# 2. Navigate to the folder with the script
cd path\to\folder

# 3. Run it
.\deploy-to-github.ps1

# 4. Follow the prompts!
```

---

### 🚀 Option 2: Quick Deploy (Simplest)

**File:** `quick-deploy.sh`

**What it does:**
- ✅ Copies all files
- ✅ Creates commit
- ✅ Pushes to GitHub
- ✅ Minimal prompts

**How to use:**

```bash
# 1. Make executable
chmod +x quick-deploy.sh

# 2. Run it
./quick-deploy.sh

# 3. Answer 2 questions, done!
```

### 🎨 Option 3: GitHub Actions (Continuous Deployment)

**File:** I'll create this for you below

**What it does:**
- ✅ Automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
- ✅ Runs tests (if configured)
- ✅ Deploys to Vercel/Netlify automatically
- ✅ No manual deployment needed

---

## 📋 What Each Script Automates

| Task | Manual | Automated Script |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Clone repository | You do it | ✅ Script does it |
| Copy files | You do it | ✅ Script does it |
| Rename README | You do it | ✅ Script does it |
| Git add | You type command | ✅ Script does it |
| Git commit | You type message | ✅ Script does it |
| Git push | You type command | ✅ Script does it |
| Error handling | You debug | ✅ Script handles |
| Status messages | You check | ✅ Script shows |

## 🚀 Complete Usage Instructions

### For Mac/Linux Users

#### Method 1: Full Script

```bash
# Navigate to where you downloaded the files
cd ~/Downloads

# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy-to-github.sh

# Run the script
./deploy-to-github.sh

# Choose option 1 (Clone and update) or 2 (Update existing)
# Follow the prompts
# Script does everything automatically!
```

#### Method 2: Quick Script

```bash
# Navigate to downloads
cd ~/Downloads

# Make executable
chmod +x quick-deploy.sh

# Run
./quick-deploy.sh

# Enter repository path (or press Enter for default)
# Confirm push
# Done!
```

---

### For Windows Users

#### Using PowerShell Script

```powershell
# Open PowerShell

# Navigate to folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads

# If you get execution policy error, run this first:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Run the script
.\deploy-to-github.ps1

# Follow the prompts!
```

---

## 🎯 What You Still Need To Do

The scripts automate everything **except**:

1. **GitHub Authentication** (one-time setup)
   - When you run `git push`, GitHub will ask you to log in
   - This is a security feature
   - You'll do this once, then it's cached

2. **Initial Repository Check**
   - Make sure you have the repository URL correct
   - Make sure you have push permissions

---

## 🔒 GitHub Authentication Setup

### First Time Setup

When the script runs `git push`, you'll be prompted to authenticate:

#### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "EmberMate Deploy"
4. Check these scopes:
   - ✅ repo (all)
   - ✅ workflow
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`)
7. When prompted for password, paste the token

#### Option B: GitHub CLI (Easiest)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # Mac
# or download from: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Follow the prompts
# Now git push will work automatically!
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied" when running script

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy-to-github.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Issue: "git command not found"

Install Git:
- **Mac:** `brew install git` or download from https://git-scm.com/
- **Windows:** Download from https://git-scm.com/
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install git` or `sudo yum install git`

### Issue: "Authentication failed"

You need to set up authentication. See [GitHub Authentication Setup](#github-authentication-setup) above.

### Issue: "Repository not found"

Make sure:
1. Repository URL is correct
2. Repository exists
3. You have access to it

---

## 🎨 Customizing the Scripts

The scripts are designed to be customizable. Here's what you can change:

### Change Repository URL

Edit the script file:

```bash
# Find this line:
REPO_URL="https://github.com/ysorallc-cloud/EmberMateV2.git"

# Change to your repository:
REPO_URL="https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git"
```

### Change Branch

```bash
# Find this line:
BRANCH="main"

# Change to your branch:
BRANCH="master"  # or "develop", etc.
```

### Change Commit Message

Edit the commit message section in the script to customize what appears in your Git history.

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

Want even more automation? Set up GitHub Actions!

I can create a workflow file that:
- ✅ Automatically deploys on every push
- ✅ Runs tests (if you add them)
- ✅ Deploys to Vercel/Netlify
- ✅ Notifies you on success/failure

**Create this file in your repository:**

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

## 📋 Summary: What's Automated

### ✅ Fully Automated
1. File copying
2. README renaming
3. Git add
4. Git commit with message
5. Status checking
6. Error handling
7. Success messages

### ⚠️ Semi-Automated (One-time setup)
1. GitHub authentication (you log in once)
2. Repository access (you need permissions)

### ❌ Cannot Automate
1. Creating GitHub account (security)
2. Repository permissions (security)
3. Initial authentication (security)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

**First Time:**
1. Run `deploy-to-github.sh`
2. Choose option 1 (Clone and update)
3. Authenticate with GitHub when prompted
4. Let script do everything else!

**Future Updates:**
1. Run `quick-deploy.sh`
2. Confirm push
3. Done in 10 seconds!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Quick Deploy for Regular Updates
The full script is great for first-time setup, but use `quick-deploy.sh` for regular updates.

### Tip 2: Set Up GitHub CLI
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```
Now git push never asks for authentication!

### Tip 3: Create an Alias
Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
alias deploy-ember="cd ~/path/to/embermate && ./quick-deploy.sh"
```
Now just type `deploy-ember` from anywhere!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Now:** Run the deployment script
2. **After deployment:** Set up GitHub Pages or Vercel
3. **Optional:** Set up GitHub Actions for continuous deployment
4. **Share:** Send your new website URL to users!
