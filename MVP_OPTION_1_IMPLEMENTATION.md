## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issue:** Users want doctor integration
**Solution:** Provide export features that users can share manually

**Potential Issue:** Competitors have more features
**Solution:** Focus on privacy and simplicity as differentiators

**Potential Issue:** App store approval delays
**Solution:** Start submission process early, prepare all required assets

**Potential Issue:** Users demand backend features
**Solution:** Phase in optional cloud features post-MVP
