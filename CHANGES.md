# EmberMate Updates - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Onboarding Function (app.js)
**Issue:** The `updateOnboardingStep()` function was missing the critical line that adds the 'active' class to the current onboarding step.

**Line 47-49 (Fixed):**
```javascript
if (currentStep) {
    currentStep.classList.add('active');
}
```

**Previous (Broken):**
```javascript
if (currentStep) {
}
```

This fix ensures that:
- Onboarding steps now properly display when users navigate through the tutorial
- The correct step becomes visible based on the currentOnboardingStep variable
- Navigation buttons work correctly to show/hide steps

### 2. CSS Whitespace Optimization
**Removed:** 5 unnecessary blank lines from styles.css

**Changes:**
- Removed consecutive blank lines within CSS rules
- Maintained section separator blank lines for readability
- Kept comment blocks intact
- **Result:** More compact CSS without sacrificing code readability

**File Sizes:**
- Original CSS: 1916 lines
- Optimized CSS: 1911 lines

### 3. No Design or Functionality Changes
As requested:
✅ No existing functions were modified (except the bug fix)
✅ No design elements were changed
✅ All features remain intact
✅ HTML structure preserved with readable indentation

## Files Updated

4. Verify each step displays correctly
5. Test "Skip Tour" and "Load Sample Data" buttons
